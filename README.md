# ocbot - AI Browser Assistant

`ocbot_agent` is the core AI extension component of the ocbot project, running as a Chrome Extension. It provides an interactive interface via the Side Panel and leverages low-level browser APIs to achieve automation.

This project is included as a **git submodule** in both [ocbot](https://github.com/instry/ocbot). You typically don't need to clone it separately — use `git clone --recursive` on the parent project instead.

## ✨ Key Features

*   **Native Browser Integration**: Deeply integrated via the Side Panel, providing a seamless browsing experience without interruption.
*   **Autonomous Agent**: Utilizes `debugger` and `scripting` permissions to read web content and perform automated actions.
*   **Privacy First**: Your data remains in your control. Supports local models via compatible interfaces.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

*   **Framework**: [WXT](https://wxt.dev/) (Web Extension Tools)
